inserting and editing
 1. double clicks will bring up the living/item dialog
 2. only one living per tile for now
 3. dragging will move livings, but not items and is meaningless to tiles

insert problems
 1. there can only be one living named joe... replace(joe=>($x,$y))
 2. there can be one billion arrows replace()? what?

saving 
 1. need to give mapqueues a way to save xml, which will simply call the
    mapgen exporter and then add items ex post facto, maybe.
    kindof a shitty problem...

    Maybe it's better to each the xml_exporter about {item} and {living}s
    in the node?
