AUTHOR'S NOTE 

I was particularly thrilled with Jamis Buck's Dungeon Generator
(http://www.aarg.net/~minam/dungeon.cgi), but I wanted to design something
a little more flexible that also allowed a little more flexibility --
particularly, new visualization and generation plugins.

SYNOPSIS

    use Games::RolePlay::MapGen;

    my $default_random_map = new Games::RolePlay::MapGen;
