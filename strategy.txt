New LoS strategy:

1. Find all the possible closed {od} between C0 and C1 as vectors.
2. Find all 16 vectors from C0 corners to C1 corners.
3. See which of the corner vectors have a projections onto the solid {od} vectors.
4. Conclusions
    a. If there's at least one corner vector without a projection, there's an LoS
    b. If any set of 4 C0 vectors have no projection, there's no cover


Also, the LoS scores should be like so, to reflect increasing scores:

0 LOS_NO
1 LOS_COVER
2 LOS_IGNORABLE_COVER
3 LOS_YES
