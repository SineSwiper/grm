=head1 NAME

Games::RolePlay::MapGen::Tools - Some support tools and objects for the mapgen suite

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Games::RolePlay::MapGen::Tools qw( filter choice roll random range str_eval );

    my $r1 = roll(1, 20);                   # 1d20
    my $r2 = random(20);                    # 0-20
    my $r3 = range(50, 100);                # some number between 50 and 100
    my $r4 = range(9000, 10000, 1);         # 100% positively correlated with the last range (ie, not random at all)
    my $r5 = range(7, 12, -1);              # 100% negatively correlated with the last range (ie, not random at all)
    my $e  = choice(qw(test this please));  # picks one of test, this, and please at random
    my $v  = str_eval("1d8");               # returns int(roll(1,8)) -- returns undef on parse error

    # filters any elements that don't evaluate to true out of the array. (eg, @a = ("test", "this"))
    my @a  = filter(qw(test this please), sub { ($_[0] =~ m/^t/ }) 

    # In case you were curious, choice and filter are actually from LPC (and probably pike).


    # This package also exports _group and _tile, which are shortcut functions for new
    # Games::RolePlay::MapGen::_tile and ::_group objects.
