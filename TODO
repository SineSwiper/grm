- finish the room dropper
  + marks pseudo-rooms with a negative corridor count

- add a door dropper...
  + considers the room/corridor boundaries (secret, locked, stuck, openable)
  + considers open corridor/corridor boundaries (slso)
  + considers closed corridor/corridor bondaries (slso)

- make the povray plugin

  + this'll prolly take care of itself during the povray plugin

- GL plugin?  Oh, yes, I think so.
  + this will be the funnest part of all
