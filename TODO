- finish the room dropper
  + this shouldn't take too horribly long

- make the povray plugin
  + this will be the funnest part of all

- split out the generic visualization stuff into a Visualization.pm
  + this'll prolly take care of itself during the povray plugin

- GL plugin?  Oh, yes, I think so.
  + this will be the funnest part of all
