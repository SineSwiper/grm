   - jettero improved the irange tests... it was behaving
     statistically stupidly and the tests missed it

0.17:  Mon Mar 28 08:58:07 EST 2005
   - jettero fixed the in-room tick marks

0.16:  Sun Mar 27 07:53:48 EST 2005
   - jettero started a cool door generator

0.15:  Sun Mar 27 07:53:41 EST 2005
   - jettero cleaned up the in-room-tick-marks

0.14:  Fri Mar 25 16:20:02 EST 2005
   - jettero further broke up the generators. Now only my
     room dropping code will be in Basic.

0.13:  Fri Mar 25 16:19:43 EST 2005
   - jettero drestroyed many nonsensical leading underscores
     on things that shouldn't have ever had them.

   - jettero just got a note from Jamis Buck -- an answer to
     a question actually. He officially approves of my
     project. Perhaps it's better to say he doesn't
     disapprove. Whatever. Thanks Jamis!

   - jettero began working on the dead-end remover, but it
     appears to have some bugs

0.07:  Fri Mar 25 10:30:15 EST 2005
   - jettero split up the generator further and added the
     sparseness code

0.06:  Thu Mar 24 11:50:57 EST 2005
   - jettero started a GD visualization object

0.05:  Thu Mar 24 11:38:11 EST 2005
   - jettero finished the perfect maze algorithm from Jemis'
     website.

0.04:  Thu Mar 24 11:08:46 EST 2005
   - jettero created a room dropper... but he needs to quick
     adapt the perfect maze algorithm before he can use it

0.03:  Sun Mar 20 08:26:58 EST 2005
   - jettero added a huge test suite for the Tools.pm

0.02:  Sun Mar 20 08:26:16 EST 2005
